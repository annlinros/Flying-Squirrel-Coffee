      "Mild sweetness reminiscent of fruit and berries with a touch of mellow caramel and an almost wine-like rounded acidity. Aromatique is a select Arabica single estate coffee, naturally processed. Handpicked beans undergo a very mild fermentation to create this highly sophisticated coffee, rich in aroma and presence. Like all the other coffees from The Flying Squirrel, Aromatique is a light roast, roasted in small batches, ground and packed on order.",

      "A fruity, buttery, slightly sweet coffee made from a long-drawn process of drying the bean with the pulp on. The perfect Buttercup, if ever there was one. This freshly roasted-on-order coffee is one of our proud artisan coffees. We leave a bit of the fruity pulp on the bean before drying it out under the glorious Kodagu sun, and this creates interesting nuances in the final tasting cup. Sunkissed by The Flying Squirrel is a truly special, finely processed Robusta.",

      "If the right coffee beans are used for cold brew, and if these right coffee beans have been roasted perfectly, the resultant brew will have a rich mouthfeel, an amplification of the big flavours - sweetness, earthiness, chocolate etc., and a clear lining of the smaller, more delicate flavours characteristic to the terroir of the coffee. The Flying Squirrel Cold Brew Blend is exactly that, we use a medium roast coffee that’s been roasted using a unique profile that delays caramelization of the bean sugars until the very last few moments of the roast. The blend contains Honey Sun Dried Arabica and some Arabica Peaberry amongst other beans.",
